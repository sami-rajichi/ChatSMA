Now that newborns can be \\ndiagnosed before they have symptoms, types may not always be used in diagnosing SMA. It may still be \\nuseful, nonetheless, to be familiar with the different types of SMA, especially in cases where a patient has a \\nmutation in the SMN1 gene not identified through newborn screening.SMA TYPES\\nAlso known as Werdnig-Hoffmann disease or \\ninfantile SMA. SMA Type 1 is the most severe and \\nmost common form of SMA, with symptoms of \\nhypotonia appearing within 6 months after birth. \\nBabies with SMA Type 1 cannot perform tasks \\nlike rolling over or sitting on their own and, if \\nuntreated, often die before age 2 years.TYPE 1\\nAlso known as intermediate SMA.

SMA Type 3 is usually diagnosed when a child \\nis between 18 months and 3 years old, but may be \\ndiagnosed as late as the teen years. Patients with SMA \\nType 3 are able to walk on their own but may lose that \\nability over time.TYPE 3\\nSMA Type 4 is very rare. Onset occurs during adulthood \\nand leads to mild muscle weakness. While symptoms \\ncan begin as early as age 18 years, they usually begin \\nafter age 35, and life expectancy is equal to that of an \\nunaffected individual.TYPE 4THE CAUSE OF  \\nSMA  SMA is caused by homozygous \\ndeletions or mutations in the survival \\nmotor neuron 1, or SMN1, gene. The \\nSMN1 gene is typically responsible for the \\nbody’s production of SMN protein, which is \\nneeded throughout the body but is particularly \\nimportant to the function of motor neurons.

Voluntary muscles produce movements like chewing, walking, breathing and talking. The disease is progressive, meaning the symptoms get worse over time. Currently, there is no cure for ALS and no effective treatment to halt, or reverse, the progression of the disease. \\nALS belongs to a wider group of disorders \\nknown as motor neuron diseases, which are caused by gradual deterioration (degeneration) and death of motor neurons. Motor neurons are nerve cells that extend from the brain to the spinal cord and to muscles throughout the body. These motor neurons initiate and provide vital communication links between the brain and the voluntary muscles. \\nMessages from motor neurons in the brain \\n(called upper motor neurons) are transmitted to motor neurons in the spinal cord and to motor nuclei of brain (called lower motor neurons) and from the spinal cord and motor nuclei of brain to a particular muscle or muscles. ', metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='2\\nIn ALS, both the upper motor neurons and \\nthe lower motor neurons degenerate or die, and stop sending messages to the muscles. Unable to function, the muscles gradually weaken, start to twitch (called fasciculations), and waste away (atrophy). Eventually, the brain loses its ability to initiate and control voluntary movements.\\nEarly symptoms of ALS usually include muscle \\nweakness or stiffness. Gradually all muscles under voluntary control are affected, and individuals lose their strength and the ability to speak, eat, move, and even breathe. \\nMost people with ALS die from respiratory \\nfailure, usually within 3 to 5 years from when the symptoms first appear. However, about 10 percent of people with ALS survive for 10 or more years.\\nWho gets ALS?\\nIn 2016 the Centers for Disease Control and\\nPrevention estimated that between 14,000 - \\n15,000 Americans have ALS. ALS is a common neuromuscular disease worldwide. It affects people of all races and ethnic backgrounds. \\nThere are several potential risk factors for \\nALS, including:\\n•Age.  Although the disease can strike at any\\nage, symptoms most commonly develop\\nbetween the ages of 55 and 75.\\n•Gender.  Men are slightly more likely than\\nwomen to develop ALS. However, as weage, the difference between men andwomen disappears.', metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='3\\n•Race and ethnicity. Most likely to develop\\nthe disease are Caucasians and non-Hispanics.\\nSome studies suggest that military veterans are about 1.5 to 2 times more likely to develop ALS. Although the reason for this is unclear, possible risk factors for veterans include exposure to lead, pesticides, and other environmental toxins. ALS is recognized as a service-connected disease by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. \\nSporadic ALS\\nThe majority of ALS cases (90 percent or more) are considered sporadic. This means the disease seems to occur at random with no clearly associated risk factors and no family history of the disease. Although family members of people with sporadic ALS are at an increased risk for the disease, the overall risk is very low and most will not develop ALS.\\nFamilial (Genetic) ALS\\nAbout 5 to 10 percent of all ALS cases are familial, which means that an individual inherits the disease from his or her parents. The familial form of ALS usually only requires one parent to carry the gene responsible for the disease. Mutations in more than a dozen genes have been found to cause familial ALS. About 25 to 40 percent of all familial cases (and a small percentage of sporadic cases) are caused by a defect in a gene known as “chromosome 9 open reading frame 72,” or C9ORF72 . Interestingly, the same mutation can \\nbe associated with atrophy of frontal-temporal lobes of the brain causing frontal-temporal lobe dementia.

Another 12 to 20 percent of familial cases result from mutations in the gene that provides instructions for the production of the enzyme copper-zinc superoxide dismutase 1 ( SOD1 ).\\nWhat are the symptoms?\\nThe onset of ALS can be so subtle that the symptoms are overlooked but gradually these symptoms develop into more obvious weakness or atrophy that may cause a physician to suspect ALS. Some of the early symptoms include:\\n•fasciculations (muscle twitches) in the arm,leg, shoulder, or tongue\\n•muscle cramps\\n•tight and stiff muscles (spasticity)\\n•muscle weakness affecting an arm, a leg, neckor diaphragm.\\n•slurred and nasal speech\\n•difficulty chewing or swallowing.\\nFor many individuals the first sign of ALS may appear in the hand or arm as they experience difficulty with simple tasks such as buttoning a shirt, writing, or turning a key in a lock. In other cases, symptoms initially affect one of the legs, and people experience awkwardness when walking or running or they notice that they are tripping or stumbling more often. \\nWhen symptoms begin in the arms or legs, \\nit is referred to as “limb onset” ALS. Other individuals first notice speech or swallowing problems, termed “bulbar onset” ALS. ', metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis.pdf', 'page': 5}),\n",

Individuals may develop problems with moving, swallowing (dysphagia), speaking or forming words (dysarthria), and breathing (dyspnea). \\nAlthough the sequence of emerging symptoms \\nand the rate of disease progression vary from person to person, eventually individuals will not be able to stand or walk, get in or out of bed on their own, or use their hands and arms. \\nIndividuals with ALS usually have difficulty \\nswallowing and chewing food, which makes it hard to eat normally and increases the risk of choking. They also burn calories at a faster rate than most people without ALS. Due to these factors, people with ALS tend to lose weight rapidly and can become malnourished. \\nBecause people with ALS usually retain their \\nability to perform higher mental processes such as reasoning, remembering, understanding, and problem solving, they are aware of their progressive loss of function and may become anxious and depressed. \\nA small percentage of individuals may experience \\nproblems with language or decision-making, and there is growing evidence that some may even develop a form of dementia over time. \\nIndividuals with ALS will have difficulty \\nbreathing as the muscles of the respiratory system weaken.

However, evidence from scientific studies suggests that both genetics and environment play a role in the development of ALS. \\nGenetics\\nAn important step toward determining ALS risk factors was made in 1993 when scientists supported by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) discovered that mutations in the SOD1  gene \\nwere associated with some cases of familial ALS. Although it is still not clear how mutations in the SOD1  gene lead to motor neuron \\ndegeneration, there is increasing evidence that the gene playing a role in producing mutant SOD1 protein can become toxic. \\nSince then, more than a dozen additional \\ngenetic mutations have been identified, many through NINDS-supported research, and each of these gene discoveries is providing new insights into possible mechanisms of ALS.\\nThe discovery of certain genetic mutations \\ninvolved in ALS suggests that changes in the processing of RNA molecules may lead to ALS-related motor neuron degeneration.

Overall, it is becoming increasingly clear that a number of cellular defects can lead to motor neuron degeneration in ALS.\\nIn 2011, another important discovery was \\nmade when scientists found that a defect in the C9ORF72  gene is not only present \\nin a significant subset of individuals with ALS but also in some people with a type of frontotemporal dementia (FTD).

Appropriate tests can exclude the possibility of other conditions. \\nMuscle and imaging tests\\nElectromyography (EMG), a special recording technique that detects electrical activity of muscle fibers, can help diagnose ALS.

The use of a feeding tube also reduces the risk of choking and pneumonia that can result from inhaling liquids into the lungs. \\nBreathing support\\nAs the muscles responsible for breathing start to weaken, people may experience shortness of breath during physical activity and difficulty breathing at night or when lying down. Doctors may test an individual’s breathing to determine when to recommend a treatment called noninvasive ventilation (NIV). NIV refers to breathing support that is usually delivered through a mask over the nose and/or mouth. Initially, NIV may only be necessary at night. When muscles are no longer able to maintain normal oxygen and carbon dioxide levels, NIV may be used full-time. NIV improves the quality of life and prolongs survival for many people with ALS.\\nBecause the muscles that control breathing \\nbecome weak, individuals with ALS may also have trouble generating a strong cough. There are several techniques to help people increase forceful coughing, including mechanical cough assist devices and breath stacking. In breath stacking, a person takes a series of small breaths without exhaling until the lungs are full, briefly holds the breath, and then expels the air with a cough.

These animal models include fruit flies, zebrafish, and rodents. \\nInitially, genetically modified animal models \\nfocused on mutations in the SOD1  gene but more \\nrecently, models have been developed for defects in the C9ORF72 , TARDP , FUS, PFN1 , TUBA4A , \\nand UBQLN2  genes.

The onset of weakness ranges from before birth to adulthood. The weakness is symmetric, \\nproximal > distal, and progressive. Before the genetic basis of SMA was understood, it was classified  into clinical \\nsubtypes based on maximum motor function achieved; however, it is now apparent that the phenotype of SMN1 -\\nassociated SMA spans a continuum without clear delineation of subtypes. With supportive care only, poor \\nweight gain with growth failure, restrictive lung disease, scoliosis, and joint contractures are common \\ncomplications; however, newly available targeted treatment options are changing the natural history of this \\ndisease.\\nDiagnosis/testing\\nThe diagnosis of SMA is established in a proband with a history of motor difficulties  or regression, proximal \\nmuscle weakness, reduced/absent deep tendon reflexes,  evidence of motor unit disease, AND/OR by the \\nidentification  of biallelic pathogenic variants in SMN1  on molecular genetic testing. Increases in SMN2  copy \\nnumber often  modify the phenotype.\\nManagement\\nTreatment of manifestations:  Therapies  targeted to the underlying disease mechanism include nusinersen \\n(Spinraza®; an antisense oligonucleotide) for the treatment of all types of SMA and onasemnogene abeparvovec-\\nxioi (Zolgensma®; gene replacement therapy) for the treatment of type I SMA. These  targeted treatments may \\nprevent the development or slow the progression of some features of SMA; efficacy  is improved when treatment \\nis initiated before symptom onset. It is unclear what the long-term effect  of these treatments will be or if new \\nphenotypes will arise in treated individuals.\\nAuthor Affiliations:  1 Center for Human Genetics Laboratory, UH Cleveland Medical Center, Case Western Reserve \\nUniversity, Cleveland, Ohio; Email: thomas.prior@uhhospitals.org. 2 Division of Neurology and Pediatrics, Oregon Health \\nand Science University, Portland, Oregon; Email: leachm@ohsu.edu; Email: finanger@ohsu.edu.\\nCopyright  © 1993-2023, University of Washington, Seattle.

Quantitative \\nPCR and MLPA methods are often  designed to detect both SMN1  and SMN2  copy number [ Anhuf et al 2003 , Arkblad et al 2006 , \\nScarciolla et al 2006 ] (see Genotype-Phenotype Correlations ).\\nTesting to determine carrier status  is reviewed in Genetic Counseling .\\nClinical Characteristics\\nClinical Description\\nSMA is characterized by muscle weakness and atrophy resulting from progressive degeneration and irreversible \\nloss of the anterior horn cells in the spinal cord (i.e., lower motor neurons) and the brain stem nuclei. The onset \\nof weakness ranges from before birth to adulthood. The weakness is symmetric, proximal greater than distal, and \\nprogressive.\\nBefore the advent of molecular diagnosis, attempts were made to classify SMA into discrete subtypes; however, it \\nis now apparent that the phenotype of SMA associated with SMN1  pathogenic variants spans a broad continuum \\nwithout clear delineation of subtypes. Newly approved treatment options (see Management , Treatment of 4 GeneReviews®', metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\Bookshelf_NBK1352.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Manifestations , Table 7 ) are changing the natural history of SMA phenotypes and blurring the boundaries even \\nfurther [ Tizzano & Finkel 2017 ]. Nonetheless, the existing classification  system ( Table 2 ) based on age of onset \\nand maximum function attained with supportive care only is useful for prognosis and management.\\nTable 2.

With supportive care only\\nSMA 0  presents with severe weakness, hypotonia, and respiratory distress at birth. There  may be a history of \\ndecreased in utero movements, joint contractures, and atrial septal defects. Infants with SMA type 0 have severe \\nrespiratory compromise/failure and, with supportive care only, rarely survive past age six months [ Dubowitz \\n1999 , MacLeod et al 1999 ]. There  have not been any published reports of infants with SMA 0 who have been \\ntreated with nusinersen or gene therapy (see Table 7 ).\\nSMA I  manifests as marked weakness and developmental motor regression before age six months. The mean age \\nof symptom onset is 2.5 months [ Lin et al 2015 ]. Infants may acquire head control and ability to roll, but quickly \\nlose these abilities. With supportive care only, affected  children do not achieve the ability to sit independently. \\nProximal, symmetric muscle weakness, lack of motor development with regression of motor function, reduced \\nor absent deep tendon reflexes,  and poor muscle tone are the major clinical manifestations. Mild contractures \\nare often  noted at the knees and, rarely, at the elbows.\\nWith supportive care only, fasciculation of the tongue is seen in most but not all infants. While the muscles of \\nthe face are relatively spared at initial presentation, bulbar weakness is present in the neonatal period or during \\nthe first few months, and infants frequently have problems sucking or swallowing, leading to growth failure and \\nrecurrent aspiration. Weakness of the intercostal respiratory muscles with relative preservation of diaphragm \\nmusculature leads to characteristic \"bell-shaped\" chest and paradoxic respiration (abdominal breathing). The \\ndiaphragm is not involved until late in the course of disease. Cognitive function is normal. Severe symptomatic \\nbradycardia has been noted in a study of the long-term survival of ventilator-dependent individuals with SMA I \\n[Bach 2007 ].\\nWith supportive care only, prospective studies of children with SMA I have shown median survival of 24 months \\n[Oskoui et al 2007 ]; however, more recent studies have shown a median time to either death or >16 hours/day of \\nventilation of 8-13.5 months [ Finkel et al 2014 , Kolb et al 2017 ]. With proactive respiratory and nutritional \\nsupportive care, survival is improving [ Grychtol et al 2018 ]. Promising new treatments are changing the natural \\nhistory of SMA I, particularly when treatment is initiated before onset of symptoms (see Table 7 ).\\nSMA II  usually manifests between ages six and 12 months; the mean age of symptom onset is 8.3 months [ Lin et \\nal 2015 ]. Although poor muscle tone may be evident at birth or within the first few months of life, individuals \\nwith SMA II may gain motor milestones slowly until about age five years. With supportive care only, the \\nmaximum motor milestone attained is the ability to sit independently when placed. Affected  individuals then \\nhave a slow decline in motor function and on average lose the ability to sit independently by the mid-teens \\n[Mercuri et al 2016 ]. Hand tremor is common. Deep tendon reflexes  are decreased to absent. Scoliosis is \\ncommon with progression of disease. Cognition is normal. Cardiac abnormalities are unlikely to develop [ Finkel \\net al 2018 ]. Progressive respiratory muscle weakness leads to restrictive lung disease that is associated with \\nmorbidity and mortality in these individuals.6 GeneReviews®', metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\Bookshelf_NBK1352.pdf', 'page': 5}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='With supportive care only, the life expectancy of persons with SMA II is not known with certainty. A review of \\nlife expectancy of 240 individuals with SMA II from Germany and Poland found that 68% of individuals with \\nSMA II were alive at age 25 years [ Zerres et al 1997 ]. The ability to stand is directly correlated with better \\npulmonary function and long-term survival. This  natural history, however, will likely be improved by newer \\ntreatments (see Table 7 ).\\nSMA III  typically manifests after  age 18 months with a mean age of onset of 39 months ± 32.6 months [ Lin et al \\n2015 ]. The legs are more severely affected  than the arms. With supportive care only, individuals walk \\nindependently but proximal muscle weakness may lead to more frequent falls or trouble walking up and down \\nstairs. Fatigue can adversely affect  quality of life and function significantly.\\nMost children with SMA III treated only with supportive care make gains in their motor function until about age \\nsix years and then experience a slow decline in function until about puberty. Puberty (until age ~20) may be \\nassociated with a more rapid decline in function for adolescents with SMA III.\\nWith supportive care only, adulthood is then associated with another, much slower decline in function [ Montes \\net al 2018 ]. Although individuals with SMA III develop the ability to walk, the vast majority will lose that ability \\nwith time. If symptom onset is before age three years, loss of ambulation typically occurs in the second decade. \\nHowever, if symptom onset is between ages three and 12 years, loss of ambulation may occur in the fourth \\ndecade [ Wadman et al 2017 ]. Individuals with SMA III have little to no respiratory muscle weakness. Cardiac \\nand cognitive functions are normal. In a retrospective study of individuals with SMA, the life expectancy of 329 \\nindividuals with SMA III from Germany and Poland treated only with supportive care was not different  from \\nthat of the general population [ Zerres et al 1997 ]. This  natural history, however, will likely be improved by newer \\ntreatments (see Table 7 ).\\nSMA IV  typically presents with muscle weakness in the second or third decade of life. There  is a specific  pattern \\nof muscle involvement, with weakness disproportionately affecting  the deltoids, triceps, and quadriceps. There  \\nmay be a loss of patellar reflexes,  with sparing of the deep tendon reflexes  in the upper extremities and Achilles. \\nIndividuals may have a hand tremor. Cardiac and cognitive functioning is normal. With supportive care only, \\nfindings  are similar to but less severe than those described for SMA III, and if loss of ambulation occurs, it may \\nbe after  the fifth decade [ Brahe et al 1995 , Clermont et al 1995 , Zerres et al 1997 , Wadman et al 2017 ]. Life \\nexpectancy is normal. SMA IV is the least common form of SMA and affects  fewer than 5% of individuals with \\nSMA [ Kolb et al 2017 ].\\nPotential Complications of SMA\\nPoor weight gain with growth failure, restrictive lung disease, scoliosis, joint contractures, and sleep difficulties  \\nare common complications of SMA in those who receive supportive care only. At this time, it is unknown what \\nlong-term complications may arise in individuals who receive early and/or presymptomatic targeted treatment.\\nNutrition/gastrointestinal\\n•Bulbar dysfunction is universal in individuals with SMA I; the bulbar dysfunction eventually becomes a \\nserious problem for persons with SMA II and only very late in the course of disease for those with SMA \\nIII.\\n•Gastrointestinal issues may include constipation, delayed gastric emptying, and potentially life-\\nthreatening gastroesophageal reflux  with aspiration.\\n•Growth failure can be addressed with gastrostomy tube placement as needed (see Management ).\\n•Nonambulatory individuals with SMA II and III are at risk of developing obesity [ Mercuri et al 2018 ].\\nRespiratory.  Children with SMA I and II (and more rarely, type III) who are treated with supportive care only \\nhave progressive decline in pulmonary function due to a combination of weak respiratory muscles, reduced \\nchest wall and lung compliance, and a reduction in alveolar multiplication [ Chng et al 2003 ].Spinal Muscular Atrophy 7', metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\Bookshelf_NBK1352.pdf', 'page': 6}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='•Respiratory failure is the most common cause of death in SMA I and II.\\n•Decreased respiratory function leads to impaired cough with inadequate clearance of lower airway \\nsecretions, hypoventilation during sleep, and recurrent pneumonia.\\n•Noninvasive ventilation, such as BiPAP , and airway clearance techniques are commonly used to improve \\nrespiratory insufficiency  in those with SMA (see Management ).\\nOrthopedic.  Scoliosis, hip dislocation, and joint contractures are common complications in individuals with \\nSMA. Scoliosis is a major problem in most persons with SMA II and in half of those with SMA III. With \\nsupportive care only:\\n•Approximately 50% of affected  children (especially those who are nonambulatory) develop spinal \\ncurvatures of more than 50 degrees (which require surgery) before age ten years;\\n•Later in the disease course, nonambulatory individuals can develop thoracic kyphosis [ Mercuri et al 2018 ];\\n•Progressive scoliosis impairs lung function and if severe can cause decreased cardiac output [ Chng et al \\n2003 ].\\nUse of the vertical expandable prosthetic titanium rib is a possible treatment for severe scoliosis (see \\nManagement ).\\nMetabolic.  An unexplained potential complication of SMA is severe metabolic acidosis with dicarboxylic \\naciduria and low serum carnitine concentrations during periods of intercurrent illness or prolonged fasting \\n[Kelley & Sladky 1986 ].\\n•Whether these metabolic abnormalities are primary or secondary to the underlying defect in SMA is \\nunknown.\\n•Although the etiology of these metabolic derangements remains unknown, one report suggests that \\naberrant glucose metabolism may play a role [ Bowerman et al 2012 ].\\n•Prolonged fasting should be avoided (see Agents/Circumstances to Avoid ).\\nPrognosis\\nThe availability of new targeted treatment options (see Table 7 ) will likely change the natural history of this \\ncondition. Furthermore, diagnosis prior to symptom onset through newborn screening programs, coupled with \\ntargeted therapies, will likely decrease the morbidity and mortality regardless of treatment strategy.\\nGenotype-Phenotype Correlations\\nSMN1 . No correlation exists between the type of SMN1  pathogenic variants and the severity of disease: the \\nhomozygous exon 7 deletion is observed with approximately the same frequency in all phenotypes.\\nSMN2 . Small amounts (up to a quarter) of full-length transcripts generated by SMN2  produce functional protein \\nand result in the milder SMA II or SMA III phenotype. The number of copies (dosage) of SMN2  (arranged in \\ntandem in cis configuration  on each chromosome) ranges from zero to five (see Molecular Genetics ). The \\npresence of two copies of SMN2  is approximately 80% predictive of the SMA I phenotype, whereas the presence \\nof four or more copies of SMN2  is approximately 88% predictive of achieving the ability to ambulate with \\nsupportive care only (SMA III/IV) [ Calucho et al 2018 ]. Modifying factors that are not fully understood are \\nlikely to contribute to the variability in clinical severity, as can be easily demonstrated with individuals who have \\nthree copies of SMN2 .

This  substitution creates a new exon splicing \\nenhancer (ESE) element. The new ESE increased the amount of exon 7 inclusion and number of full-\\nlength transcripts generated from SMN2 .\\n•In some rare families with unaffected  females who have biallelic SMN1  deletions, the expression of plastin \\n3 (encoded by PLS3  at chromosome locus Xq23) was higher than in their SMA-affected  counterparts. \\nPLS3  was shown to be important for axonogenesis and therefore may act as a protective modifier  [Oprea \\net al 2008 ].\\nNomenclature\\nSMA I was previously known as Werdnig-Hoffmann  disease or acute SMA [ Hoffmann  1892 , Werdnig 1971 ].\\nSMA II was called chronic SMA or Dubowitz disease prior to the current classification.\\nSMA III has had the eponym \"Kugelberg-Welander disease\" and has also been referred to as juvenile SMA \\n[Kugelberg & Welander 1956 ].\\nSMA IV may also be referred to as adolescent- or adult-onset SMA.\\nPrevalence\\nThe exact prevalence of SMA is unknown.

Two treatment options that are targeted to the underlying mechanism that \\nleads to SMA have become available and have been shown to have a positive effect  on disease progression (see \\nTable 7 ). These  treatments are likely to also have a positive impact on the natural history of SMA [ Finkel et al \\n2017 , Mendell et al 2017 , Finkel et al 2018 , Mercuri et al 2018 ], particularly if treatment is initiated prior to \\nsymptom onset.\\nThe decision of when to initiate targeted therapy after  detection of an affected  individual via newborn screening \\nrelies on genotype and presence of symptoms [ Glascock et al 2018 ]. After  confirmatory  SMN1  genetic testing:\\n•Targeted treatment is recommended for all individuals who have two or three copies of SMN2 , regardless \\nof whether symptoms are present;\\n•For individuals who have one copy of SMN2 , targeted treatment is left to the discretion of the treating \\nphysician, taking into account the severity of symptoms, which may have been present prenatally or at \\nbirth;\\n•For individuals with four or more copies of SMN2 , targeted treatment can be deferred until symptom \\nonset, although careful monitoring for the development of symptoms by a neuromuscular expert is \\nrecommended.\\nTable 7.

Further, event-free survival (\"event\" defined  as death or requirement for permanent assisted ventilation) was higher in the nusinersen \\ngroup than in the control group (hazard ratio 0.53; P=0.005) as was the likelihood of overall survival (hazard ratio 0.37; P=0.004) \\n[Finkel et al 2017 ].\\n3.

The antisense oligonucleotide is a single-stranded RNA molecule that is specifically  designed to bind to the ISS-N1 regulatory motif \\nin the intron downstream of exon 7 in the SMN2  pre-mMRA [ Rigo et al 2014 ]. Binding at this site promotes inclusion of exon 7, \\nleading to increased full-length SMN  mRNA and thus full-length SMN protein.\\n7. A Phase I trial in 15 individuals with SMA type I showed event-free survival (\"event\" = death or need for permanent ventilator \\nassistance) at age 20 months in all 15 compared with only 8% of historical controls [ Mendell et al 2017 ].\\n8.

From the collective experience, it appears that women with SMA may \\nhave an increased rate of preterm birth (27%) and need for cesarean section (41%) [ Awater et al 2012 , Elsheikh \\net al 2017 ] compared to unaffected  women. While local anesthesia is preferred to general anesthesia in women \\nwith SMA, an epidural can be difficult  in people with severe scoliosis or spinal fusions [ Awater et al 2012 , Finkel \\net al 2018 ]. Women with SMA may also experience a persistent worsening of their general muscle weakness after \\ndelivery (32%) [ Awater et al 2012 , Elsheikh et al 2017 ]. Severe respiratory distress with maternal hypercapnia \\nand hypoxemia was attributed to one stillbirth at 26 weeks' gestation [ Awater et al 2012 ]. Due to the risk of \\nrespiratory failure, it is recommended that women with neuromuscular disorders, including those with SMA, \\nobtain baseline pulmonary function prior to becoming pregnant, with frequent monitoring during pregnancy \\n[Norwood & Rudnik-Schöneborn 2012 ].\\nNo human pregnancies have been reported to have occurred during/after  treatment with nusinersen. It is also \\nunknown if nusinersen is excreted through human breast milk. Animal models do not show an increased risk for \\nadverse fetal outcome with nusinersen exposure, or risk for future male or female infertility. However, as the risk \\nto a developing human fetus has not been determined, it has been recommended that women discontinue \\ntreatment with nusinersen prior to conception.\\nThere  have not been any reported cases of pregnant women with SMA treated with gene therapy.\\nTherapies Under Investigation\\nA number of different  therapeutic approaches are in development, including further studies on the approved \\ntherapeutics discussed above. Newer approaches (including some directed at increasing full-length SMN protein \\nfrom SMN2 , use of gene therapy to restore SMN1 , and SMN-independent approaches) are being actively \\ninvestigated; see Shorrock et al [2018] .\\nSMN2- targeted therapeutic approaches.  Therapeutic  approaches in this category aim to alter SMN2  splicing to \\nincrease the proportion of transcripts containing exon 7 and thus increase full-length SMN protein. Antisense \\noligonucleotides are single-stranded RNA molecules specifically  designed to target complementary sequences in \\nthe SMN2 transcript leading to inclusion of exon 7. Nusinersen also works through this mechanism. At least two \\nadditional SNM2  splicing modifiers  are currently in clinical trials in SMA, including Novartis Pharmaceuticals \\nLMI070 ( NCT02268552 ) and Roche RG7916 ( NCT02633709 ). Both of these agents are delivered orally. Results \\nof these trials are not yet available.\\nSMN-independent approaches.

SMN2  predominantly produces a survival motor neuron protein that is lacking in exon 7, a \\nless stable protein. SMA is caused by loss of SMN1  because SMN2  cannot fully compensate for loss of SMN1-\\nproduced protein. However, when the SMN2  (dosage) copy number is increased, the small amount of full-length \\ntranscript generated by SMN2  is often  able to produce a milder type II or type III phenotype.\\nSMN1  and SMN2\\nGene structure.  The SMN region on chromosome 5q12.2-q13.3 is unusually complex, with repetitive sequences, \\npseudogenes, retrotransposable elements, deletions, and inverted duplications [ Biros & Forrest 1999 ]. \\nUnaffected  individuals have two genes encoding SMN protein that are arranged in tandem on each \\nchromosome: SMN1  (telomeric copy, NM_000344.3 ) and SMN2  (centromeric copy, NM_017411.3 ).\\n•Other terms that have been used to identify SMN1 : telSMN, SMNt (t for telomeric), SMNT\\n•Other terms that have been used to identify SMN2 : cenSMN, SMNc (c for centromeric), BCD541, SMNC\\nSMN1  and SMN2  each comprise nine exons and differ  only in eight nucleotides (5 intronic; 3 exonic, 1 each \\nlocated within exons 6, 7, and 8) [ Biros & Forrest 1999 ]. SMN1  and SMN2  share more than 99% nucleotide \\nidentity, and both are capable of encoding a 294-amino acid RNA-binding protein, SMN, which is required for \\nefficient  assembly of snRNP complexes.\\nFor a detailed summary of gene and protein information, see Table A , Gene .\\nPathogenic variants.  Loss of SMN1  causes SMA. Individuals with SMA are either homozygous for a deletion of \\nat least exon 7 of SMN1  or are compound heterozygous for such a deletion along with an intragenic SMN1 \\ninactivating pathogenic variant. Exon 7 of SMN1  is undetectable in more than 95% of individuals with SMA \\nirrespective of the clinical subtype of SMA, either as a result of homozygous deletions or gene conversion of \\nSMN1  sequence into SMN2  sequences (possible because of their high nucleotide identity).\\nTable 9.

       " Document(page_content='Normal gene product.  SMN is localized to novel nuclear structures called \"gems\"; gems appear similar to (and \\npossibly interact with) coiled bodies, which are thought to play a role in the processing and metabolism of small \\nnuclear RNAs [ Liu & Dreyfuss 1996 ]. Evidence supports a role for SMN protein in snRNP (small nuclear \\nribonuclear protein) biogenesis and function [ Fischer et al 1997 , Liu et al 1997 , Pellizzoni et al 1998 ]. SnRNPs \\nand possibly other splicing components require regeneration from inactivated to activated functional forms. \\nSMN is required for reassembly and regeneration of these splicing components [ Pellizzoni et al 1998 ]. SMN \\naccomplishes this in a modular way, bringing together several RNA-binding proteins with several RNAs, \\nfacilitating the assembly of specific  proteins on the target RNAs.\\nThe SMN protein has also been reported to influence  other cellular activities such as apoptosis and translational \\nregulation [ Strasswimmer et al 1999 , Lefebvre et al 2002 , Vyas et al 2002 ]. SMN modulates apoptosis by blocking \\nthe activation of several caspases and other key regulators of cell survival [ Anderton et al 2013 ]. SMN regulates \\ntranslation by associating with polysomes, resulting in repression of translation [ Sanchez et al 2013 ].\\nAbnormal gene product.  SMA may be the result of a genetic defect in the biogenesis and trafficking  of the \\nspliceosomal snRNP complexes. Mutated SMN, such as that found in individuals with SMA, lacks the splicing-\\nregeneration activity of wild type SMN. Reduced SMN lowers the capacity of cells to assemble the snRNPs, \\nwhich leads to altered levels of spliceosomal components and defects in splicing, and impaired capacity to \\nproduce specific  mRNAs and their encoded proteins that are necessary for cellular growth and function. It \\nremains unclear how a defect of splicing results in a motor neuron-specific  disorder [ Workman et al 2012 ].\\nChapter Notes\\nAuthor History\\nErika Finanger, MD (2016-present)\\nMeganne E Leach, MSN, PNP (2019-present)\\nThomas  W Prior, PhD, FACMG (2000-present)\\nBarry S Russman, MD; Oregon Health and Science University (2000-2016)\\nRevision History\\n•3 December 2020 (aa/ha) Revision: GARS1 -related infantile-onset SMA added to Table 5\\n•14 November 2019 (ma) Comprehensive update posted live\\n•22 December 2016 (sw) Comprehensive update posted live\\n•14 November 2013 (me) Comprehensive update posted live\\n•27 January 2011 (me) Comprehensive update posted live\\n•3 April 2006 (me) Comprehensive update posted live\\n•15 July 2004 (br) Revision: Management\\n•17 October 2003 (me) Comprehensive update posted live\\n•24 February 2000 (me) Review posted live\\n•28 February 1999 (br) Original submission\\nReferences\\nPublished Guidelines / Consensus Statements\\nFinkel RS, Mercuri E, Meyer OH, Simonds AK, Schroth MK, Graham RJ, Kirschner J, Iannaccone ST, Crawford \\nTO, Woods S, Muntoni F, Wirth B, Montes J, Main M, Mazzone ES, Vitale M, Snyder B, Quijano-Roy S, \\nBertini E, Davis RH, Qian Y , Sejersen T, et al.

       " Document(page_content='Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a genetic \\nneuromuscular disorder affecting approximately \\n1 in 10,000  live births. It is estimated to affect \\nroughly 10,000 children and adults  in the United \\nStates, and about 1 in every 50 Americans  is a \\ngenetic carrier. The disease can affect infants and \\nadults of any race or gender. \\nSMA is classified as a motor neuron disease,  \\na progressive neuromuscular disorder that \\ndestroys muscle-controlling nerve cells called \\nmotor neurons. In SMA,  motor neurons  in  \\nthe spinal cord are affected.\\nIn the most common form of SMA ( chromosome \\n5 SMA, or SMN-related SMA ), loss of or muta -\\ntion in the  survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1)  gene \\ninterferes with the production of SMN protein,  \\nwhich is needed to maintain healthy, function -\\nal motor neurons. Without SMN protein, motor \\nneurons degenerate and become nonfunction -\\nal. When this happens, they are no longer able \\nto send signals to muscles, which then weak -\\nen and become smaller because of inactivity. \\nThe SMN1  gene  is located on chromosome \\n5. The neighboring SMN2 genes  can partially \\ncompensate for nonfunctional SMN1  gene by \\nmaking some SMN protein, and some of the \\ntherapeutic strategies for chromosome 5 SMA \\nfocus on encouraging the production of fully \\nfunctional SMN protein from this “backup” gene.\\nOther forms of SMA are not related to a loss of \\nthe SMN1 gene, arising instead from defects in \\ndifferent genes on different chromosomes.  \\nThese forms vary greatly in severity and in the \\nmuscles most affected. People can have multiple copies of the SMN2  \\ngene. The more SMN2  genes  a person has,  \\nthe more functional  SMN protein is available \\nand the milder the SMA disease  course is  \\nlikely to be. Genetic testing can determine how \\nmany SMN2  genes a person has and roughly \\npredict the course of SMA that is likely to result.\\nAll known forms of SMA are genetic  and  \\nhave different inheritance patterns and \\nimplications for family planning. If you or your \\nchild has received an SMA diagnosis, talk with \\nyour doctor, and perhaps a genetic counselor to \\nfind out more about the genetics and prognosis \\nfor the particular form of SMA involved.\\nThere is no cure for SMA, but the first disease-\\nmodifying therapy was recently approved in 2016. \\nAdditional medications and therapy can also  \\nhelp manage some symptoms of the disease.What is...\\nSpinal Muscular \\nAtrophy  A Guide for \\nPatients and \\nFamilies', metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\MDA_SMA_Fact_Sheet_June_2019.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

      "Response :  SMA, or Spinal Muscular Atrophy, is a genetic disorder that affects the nerve cells responsible for controlling voluntary muscle movement, particularly those in the limbs, face, and throat. It results in progressive muscle weakness and atrophy, leading to difficulty breathing, swallowing, and mobility issues. There are three types of SMA, ranging from mild to severe, and it is usually diagnosed in infancy or childhood.\n",
      "Response :  There are three main types of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA): SMA type 1, SMA type 2, and SMA type 3. The characteristics of each type are as follows:\n",
      "* SMA type 1: This is the most severe form of the disease, with symptoms present from birth or before. Motor function deteriorates rapidly, leading to significant disability and respiratory problems.\n",
      "* SMA type 2: This type has a later onset than SMA type 1, typically appearing between 6 months and 2 years of age. Symptoms progress more slowly than in SMA type 1, but still result in significant motor function loss and respiratory difficulties.\n",
      "* SMA type 3: Also known as adult-onset SMA, this type has a delayed onset and typically presents between the ages of 2 and 17 years. The progression of symptoms is slower than in SMA types 1 and 2, but still leads to significant motor function loss and respiratory problems.\n",
